# HttpClientBasics

This repository contains the project that was worked on during our second workshop: Basics of Mobile App Architecture.
 
Each commit corresponds to a section in the workshop, so you can check the [commit history](https://github.com/Beyhum/HttpClientBasics/commits/master) and follow up on each change step by step. 

The purpose of this project is to learn how a client connects to a server and communicates with it through HTTP.

Please keep in mind that the server we are communicating with is not using HTTPS since it is purely for testing/demoing purposes.
HTTPS must be enabled in production environments, otherwise your application will have a huge and easily exploitable security hole.

Do not consider this project as an ideal reference on how to build a robust Console Application.
